There is a complicated struggle with the deaf community to enhance their abilities or even gain much-needed exposure to communicate with society. That includes asking a certain direction from someone, having to commute from one location to another through public transport or even having to have a normal and viable conversation with someone. As it may not be a problem with the people who understand their language, there's a plethora of people or a whole society that would come across as bewildered when approached by a deaf person due to the lack of understanding of the expressivity gestured by them. Among having complications with the society for a hearing impaired individual, there’s an overabundance of challenges that they encounter. Individuals born with hearing-impaired since birth would struggle in learning the commonly used English language, due to either the sign language interpreters or even generally finding teachers who understand the sign language. Apart from education, individuals from the deaf community would also struggle in seeking employment to pursue a career. There are firms that employ certain deaf people, but still, there’s quite a mile to follow and fit into certain requirements. Overall lack of awareness generally affects the hearing impaired community abundantly.
